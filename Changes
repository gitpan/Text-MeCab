Changes
=======

0.06 - 08 May 2006
  - Require ExtUtils::MakeMaker >= 6.25 to avoid Build.PL being
    executed after Makefile.PL
  - Fix INIT -> PREINIT (reported by charsbar)
  - Fix how XSRETURN_UNDEF was working (reported by charsbar)
  - Fix tools/probe_mecab.pl (reported by charsbar)
  - Use ppport.h.

0.05 - 04 May 2006
  - Fix typos
  - Add tests to MANIFEST. argh.
  - Actually test against libmecab < 0.90. Now tests pass.
  - Bump up version to 0.05 for historical reasons. There was another
    version of Text::MeCab that MAKAMAKA had written which went up to
    0.04.

0.02_03 - 04 May 2006
  - Correct reference counting for prev().
  - Add tests for detatched Text::MeCab::Node.
  - Tweak docs

0.02_02 - 04 May 2006
  - Fix tools/probe_mecab.pl such that it prompts the user for some
    required parameters when installing on Windows.
  - Try fixing Makefile.PL once again.
  - Explicitly make copies of mecab_node_t in the XS, so that you
    can now manipulate the nodes even *after* your instance of
    Text::MeCab has gone away

0.02_01 - 03 May 2006
  - Hey, I didn't know people were going to jump on to this module,
    seriously... 

  - Fix building when using Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL
    (refactor important bits to tools/probe_mecab.pl).
  - Attempt to work with MeCab < 0.90.
  - Move benchmark.pl to tools/benchmark.pl.
  - Fix problem caused by Text::MeCab->new() (no parameters).
  - Add Text::MeCab::MECAB_VERSION to display the mecab version
    we compiled against.

  TODO:
  - Try to at least give out a warning when executing a code like this:

    my $node;
    {
        my $mecab = Text::MeCab->new;
        $mecab->parse("......");
        $mecab = undef;
    }

    for(; $node; $node = $node->next) {
       print $node->surface, "\n";
    }

    I'm having a hard time detecting when a node is deallocated, though.
    we shall see.
