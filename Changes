0.02_01 - 03 May 2006
  - Hey, I didn't know people were going to jump on to this module,
    seriously... 

  - Fix building when using Makefile.PL instead of Build.PL.
    (refactor important bits to tools/probe_mecab.pl)
  - Attempt to work with MeCab < 0.90.
  - Move benchmark.pl to tools/benchmark.pl
  - Fix problem caused by Text::MeCab->new() (no parameters)

  TODO:
  - Try to at least give out a warning when executing a code like this:

    my $node;
    {
        my $mecab = Text::MeCab->new;
        $mecab->parse("......");
        $mecab = undef;
    }

    for(; $node; $node = $node->next) {
       print $node->surface, "\n";
    }

    I'm having a hard time detecting when a node is deallocated, though.
    we shall see.
